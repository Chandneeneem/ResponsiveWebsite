                Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. There are many debates about
                its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is whether
                part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student is an improvement. Some researchers
                stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These disagreements
                affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term can also refer to the mental
                states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field studying
                education.
                Many thick and prescriptive conceptions rely on the aims of education to explain their view. This means
                that they see education as an activity that tries to achieve certain aims.[19][20][21] These aims can be
                classified into different categories. There is one category for epistemic goods, like knowledge and
                understanding. Another category covers skills, like rationality and critical thinking. Additionally,
                there are character traits, like kindness and honesty

                Education is often divided into types. The most common division is between formal, non-formal, and
                informal education. However, some theorists only distinguish between formal and informal education.
                Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework. Such frameworks have a chronological and
                hierarchical order. For instance, the modern schooling system has classes based on the student's age and
                progress, all the way from primary school to university. Formal education is usually controlled and
                guided by the government. It is normally compulsory up to a certain age.[33][34]

                Non-formal and informal education take place outside the formal schooling system. Non-formal education
                is a middle ground. Like formal education, it is organized, systematic, and carried out with a clear
                purpose in mind. Examples are tutoring, fitness classes, and the scouting movement.[35] Informal
                education, on the other hand, happens in an unsystematic way through daily experiences and exposure to
                the environment. Unlike formal and non-formal education, there is usually no designated authority figure
                responsible for teaching.Informal education is present in many settings. It happens throughout one's
                life, mostly in a spontaneous way. This is how children learn their mother tongue from their parents or
                how people learn to prepare a dish by cooking together.

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">The Role Of society!</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education plays various roles in society, including in social, economic,
                and personal fields. On a social level, education makes it possible to establish and sustain a stable
                society. It helps people acquire the basic skills needed to interact with their environment and fulfill
                their needs and desires. In modern society, this involves a wide range of skills like being able to
                speak, read, and write as well as to solve problems and to perform basic arithmetic tasks. It also
                includes the ability to handle information and communications technology. Children are socialized into
                society by acquiring these skills. Another key part of socialization is to learn how to live in social
                groups and interact with others by coming to understand social and cultural norms and expectations. This
                requires an understanding of what kinds of behavior are considered appropriate in different contexts.
                This way, new members are introduced to the culture, norms, and values that are dominant in their
                society. Socialization happens throughout life but is of special relevance to early childhood education.
                It enables a form of social cohesion, stability, and peace needed for people to productively engage in
                their daily business. Education plays a key role in democracies by increasing civic participation in the
                form of voting and organizing and through its tendency to promote equal opportunity for all</p>
